# Automation of Analysis of Stock Data
Automated analysis of 12 stocks to uncover annual trends for investment research.

### Purpose
Investors have selected a stock they are interested in without any research. A dataset of daily stock outcomes over 2 years was collected for this stock and 11 others.
